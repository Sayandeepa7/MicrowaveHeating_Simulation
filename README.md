# Simulating Microwave Heating in Heterogeneous Materials Using Python

This repository contains a computational framework for simulating the dynamics of microwave heating in heterogeneous materials, such as food particles. The simulation integrates electromagnetic wave propagation (via Maxwell's equations) and heat transfer (via the heat equation) to model the interplay between microwave energy absorption and thermal diffusion.

### Key Features
1. **Electromagnetic Simulation (FDTD Method):**
   - Models microwave propagation using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique.
   - Captures spatial and temporal dynamics of electric (\(E_z\)) and magnetic (\(H_x, H_y\)) fields.
   - Incorporates heterogeneous dielectric properties to simulate realistic material interactions.

2. **Energy Absorption and Heat Transfer:**
   - Computes power density (\(E^2\)) to represent energy absorption.
   - Couples electromagnetic heating with the heat equation to simulate temperature evolution.

3. **Heterogeneous Material Modeling:**
   - Allows for spatial variations in material properties like permittivity, conductivity, and thermal conductivity.

4. **Advanced Visualizations:**
   - Generates heatmaps of temperature distribution and plots of temperature dynamics over time.

### Applications
- **Food Science and Processing:**
  - Simulates heating patterns for uniform cooking, defrosting, or sterilization.
  - Models the impact of varying water and fat content on microwave energy absorption.
- **Material Science:**
  - Investigates microwave-material interactions in polymers, ceramics, and biological tissues.
- **Microwave Device Design:**
  - Guides the optimization of microwave ovens and other devices to minimize hotspots and uneven heating.

### Workflow
1. **Electromagnetic Simulation:**
   - Solve Maxwell's equations to compute microwave fields and energy absorption.
2. **Thermal Simulation:**
   - Solve the heat equation to model temperature changes due to microwave heating.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize temperature distribution, power density, and dynamic temperature evolution.
